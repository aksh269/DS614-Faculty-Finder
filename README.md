# DS614 - Big Data Engineering Project: Faculty Finder & Recommender

**Live Deployment:** [https://ds614-faculty-finder-production.up.railway.app](https://ds614-faculty-finder-production.up.railway.app)

---

## Project Overview

This repository houses the complete end-to-end solution for the **DS614 Big Data Engineering** project. It consists of two main components working in tandem:

1.  **Faculty Finder (Data Pipeline)**: A robust ETL pipeline that scrapes, cleans, and stores faculty data from the university website.
2.  **Faculty Recommender (Application)**: An intelligent search engine that allows users to find faculty members based on research interests using a custom Vector Space Model.

## Repository Modules

The project is structured into two distinct modules, each responsible for a specific part of the system:

| Module | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[`DS614-Faculty-Finder`](./DS614-Faculty-Finder)** | **The Backend / Data Pipeline**. Handles data scraping (Ingestion), cleaning (Transformation), and storage (SQLite). | Python, Scrapy, Pandas, SQLite, FastAPI |
| **[`DS614-Faculty-Recommender`](./DS614-Faculty-Recommender)** | **The Frontend / Search Engine**. Implements the recommendation logic and user interface. | Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn (custom implementation), Docker |

## Documentation & Setup

Each module handles its own dependencies and execution instructions. Please refer to the specific README files for detailed setup guides.

### 1. Data Pipeline Setup
For instructions on running the scraper, cleaning data, and querying the database, refer to:
👉 **[Faculty Finder Documentation](./DS614-Faculty-Finder/README.md)**

### 2. Search Application Setup
For instructions on running the recommendation engine, building the search index, and starting the web UI, refer to:
👉 **[Faculty Recommender Documentation](./DS614-Faculty-Recommender/README.md)**

**Quick Start (Docker):**
The search application is containerized and can be run immediately with Docker:
```bash
cd DS614-Faculty-Recommender
docker build -t faculty-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 faculty-app
```
Click on the link: 
```bash

## Recommendation Algorithm

The search engine moves beyond simple keyword matching by implementing a **Vector Space Model (VSM)** from scratch:

- **Preprocessing**: Handles raw text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and merging domain-specific phrases (e.g., "Deep Learning" becomes `deep_learning`).
- **Weighting (TF-IDF)**: Uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to prioritize unique and meaningful terms over common words.
- **Ranking (Cosine Similarity)**: Results are ranked based on the cosine similarity between the user's query vector and the faculty profile vectors.
- **Field Boosting**: Different sections of a profile are weighted differently; for example, a match in "Research Interests" (3x weight) is considered more relevant than a match in the "Bio".

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Railway and is accessible publicly for demonstration:
