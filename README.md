## DS614 (Big Data Engineering) Project Overview

Faculty Finder is a data engineering project that automates the entire process of collecting, cleaning, storing, and serving faculty information from the DA-IICT website. Instead of manually browsing multiple pages, the system converts scattered and unstructured faculty details—such as biographies, research interests, and publications—into a clean, structured, and searchable format.

The project implements a complete data pipeline that includes web scraping, data transformation, database storage, and API-based data access. The processed data is stored in a SQLite database and exposed through a FastAPI REST API in JSON format, making it easy to use for analytics, machine learning, or future semantic search applications. The focus of this project is on building a reliable, modular, and real-world data pipeline that reflects how data engineering systems are designed in practice.


## Problem Statement

Faculty information on university websites is often spread across multiple pages and presented in inconsistent formats, which makes it difficult to search, analyze, or reuse the data effectively. Basic keyword searches are limited and do not capture the actual research expertise or interests of faculty members.

The goal of this project is to build a system that can automatically extract faculty data, clean and standardize it, and store it in a structured form that supports efficient querying and future intelligent search. The system is designed to handle common real-world challenges such as missing information, noisy text, and inconsistent web structures, while providing easy access to the data through a RESTful API for researchers and data-driven applications.

## Data Pipeline Description

The project implements a complete and automated data pipeline that processes faculty information from raw web pages to a structured and queryable format. Each stage of the pipeline is modular, allowing individual components to be executed, tested, and extended independently.

### Ingestion

The ingestion stage is responsible for collecting raw faculty data from the official DA-IICT website. This step is implemented using **Scrapy**, which crawls multiple faculty listing pages and extracts individual faculty profile information.

Key responsibilities:
- Crawling faculty and adjunct faculty pages
- Extracting profile-level data such as name, biography, research interests, and publications
- Handling missing fields and malformed HTML structures
- Safely storing the scraped data as a raw CSV file

**Output:**  
`data/raw/Faculty_DAIICT.csv`

---

### Transformation

The transformation stage cleans and standardizes the raw scraped data to ensure consistency and usability. This step focuses on removing noise, normalizing text fields, and preparing the data for storage and downstream analysis.

Key responsibilities:
- Cleaning HTML tags and unwanted characters
- Normalizing faculty names and email addresses
- Standardizing research and specialization fields
- Generating unique faculty identifiers
- Creating a `combined_text` field for NLP and semantic search use cases

**Output:**  
`data/cleaned/transformed_faculty_data.csv`

---

### Storage

The storage stage persists the cleaned data in a relational database for efficient querying and long-term storage. A **SQLite** database is used due to its simplicity and suitability for lightweight data engineering workflows.

Key responsibilities:
- Creating database tables if they do not exist
- Validating required fields before insertion
- Inserting cleaned faculty records into the database
- Ensuring transactional safety and rollback on failure

**Database:**  
`data/database/faculty.db`

---

### Serving (API)

The serving stage exposes the stored faculty data through a **FastAPI-based REST API**. This allows external applications, data scientists, or search systems to access the data in a structured and scalable manner.

Key responsibilities:
- Providing REST endpoints to fetch all faculty records
- Supporting retrieval of individual faculty records by ID
- Returning responses in JSON format
- Enabling easy integration with analytics, ML models, or frontend systems


## Database Schema

The project uses a **SQLite** relational database to store cleaned and structured faculty information. The schema is designed to be lightweight, easy to query, and suitable for academic as well as development-oriented use cases.

### Table: `faculty`

| Column Name     | Data Type | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| faculty_id      | TEXT      | Unique identifier for each faculty member (Primary Key) |
| name            | TEXT      | Faculty member’s full name |
| mail            | TEXT      | Official email address |
| phd_field       | TEXT      | Educational background / PhD field |
| specialization  | TEXT      | Areas of specialization (comma-separated) |
| bio             | TEXT      | Faculty biography |
| research        | TEXT      | Research interests and focus areas |
| publications    | TEXT      | List of publications (stored as text) |
| combined_text   | TEXT      | Combined textual representation for search and NLP |

The `faculty_id` column serves as the primary key to ensure uniqueness across records. Text-based fields are used to accommodate variable-length content such as biographies, research descriptions, and publication details.

The `combined_text` field is generated by combining the faculty biography (`bio`), research interests (`research`), areas of specialization (`specialization`), and educational background (`phd_field`) into a single, rich text representation. This field is specifically designed to support downstream NLP tasks and future semantic or vector-based search functionality.


## How the Project Works (Step-by-Step Execution Flow)

This project is organized as a modular data engineering system where each component has a clear responsibility. The workflow is designed so that a reviewer can either inspect individual modules or run the complete pipeline end-to-end without confusion.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and Prepare the Environment
After cloning the repository, the reviewer installs the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. All configurable parameters such as file paths, database location, and pipeline control flags are defined in `config/settings.py`. These settings decide whether the ingestion, transformation, and database stages should run, without requiring any changes to the core code.

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Modular Pipeline Design
The project is divided into four logical modules:
- **Ingestion**: Scrapes raw faculty data from the DA-IICT website  
- **Transformation**: Cleans and normalizes the scraped data  
- **Storage**: Stores cleaned data into a SQLite database  
- **Serving (API)**: Exposes stored data through a FastAPI application  

Each module can be understood independently, but they are also connected through a final unified pipeline.

---

### Step 3: Ingestion Module (Web Scraping)
The ingestion logic is implemented using Scrapy in the file:

`ingestion/daiict_faculty/spiders/daufaculty.py`

This spider crawls official DA-IICT faculty pages and extracts information such as faculty name, biography, research interests, specialization, and publications. The scraped output is stored exactly as collected in:

`data/raw/Faculty_DAIICT.csv`

This raw file is intentionally preserved so that the original data source can always be inspected or reprocessed if needed.

---

### Step 4: Transformation Module (Data Cleaning)
The transformation logic is implemented in:

`transformation/transform_pipeline.py`

This module reads the raw CSV file from `data/raw/Faculty_DAIICT.csv` and performs cleaning and normalization steps such as removing HTML noise, fixing encoding issues, validating emails, normalizing text fields, and generating unique faculty IDs. Multiple descriptive fields (bio, research, specialization, and PhD field) are merged into a single `combined_text` column for future NLP use.

The cleaned output is written to:

`data/cleaned/transformed_faculty_data.csv`

---

### Step 5: Storage Module (SQLite Database)
The storage layer is responsible for persisting the cleaned data. Database connection and schema creation are handled in:

`storage/db_connection.py`

Data insertion logic is implemented in:

`storage/database_insertion.py`

If the database or required tables do not exist, they are created automatically. The cleaned data from `data/cleaned/transformed_faculty_data.csv` is inserted into the SQLite database located at:

`data/database/faculty.db`

Each record is inserted safely, and any problematic rows are logged without stopping the entire insertion process.

---

### Step 6: Running the Final Unified Pipeline
Instead of manually running each module, the project provides a final pipeline runner located at:

`scripts/__main__.py`

When this file is executed, it sequentially runs:
1. The ingestion module (scraping)
2. The transformation module (cleaning)
3. The storage module (database insertion)

This ensures a clean and reproducible execution flow. Logs generated during execution are stored in the `logs/` directory for transparency and debugging.

---

### Step 7: Serving the Data Through the API
Once the database is populated, the API can be started independently. The FastAPI application entry point is:

`api/main.py`

The API connects directly to the SQLite database and exposes endpoints to fetch all faculty records or retrieve a specific faculty member using their unique faculty ID. All responses are returned in JSON format, making the data easy to consume for evaluation, analytics, or future machine learning applications.

---

### Step 8: Final Outcome
At the end of execution, the project delivers a complete and traceable data system: raw data is preserved, cleaned data is structured, the database ensures persistence, and the API provides controlled access. The modular design ensures that each step is transparent, testable, and easy to verify for anyone reviewing the project.


## Error Handling and Logging

To make the pipeline reliable and reviewer-proof, the project includes practical error handling at every critical stage. Instead of failing fast, the system is designed to **log issues, skip problematic data, and continue execution safely**.

**Scraping-Level Safety**  
Network issues and unreachable pages are handled using Scrapy’s error callback, ensuring the crawler continues even if some requests fail.

    def errback_http(self, failure):
        self.logger.error(f"HTTP error occurred: {repr(failure)}")

Profiles missing mandatory information (such as faculty name) are skipped explicitly to prevent corrupted records from entering the dataset.

    if not name:
        raise DropItem("Faculty name missing")

**Transformation-Level Validation**  
During data cleaning, invalid or malformed values are handled using validation logic instead of raising exceptions. This ensures noisy real-world data does not interrupt the pipeline.

    def validate_email(email):
        return email if isinstance(email, str) and "@" in email else None

**Database-Level Protection**  
Each faculty record is inserted individually. If a single record fails due to data inconsistency, it is logged and skipped without stopping the full insertion process.

    try:
        cursor.execute(insert_query, (...))
    except Exception as row_error:
        logger.warning("Failed to insert row: %s", row_error)

If a critical database error occurs, the transaction is rolled back to maintain data integrity.

    except Exception as e:
        conn.rollback()
        raise RuntimeError(f"Data insertion error: {e}")

**Logging Strategy**  
Across all stages, Python’s logging module records execution flow, warnings, and failures. This makes debugging straightforward and ensures anyone reviewing the project can clearly understand what happened, where, and why.

Overall, this approach makes the pipeline fault-tolerant, transparent, and suitable for real-world data engineering scenarios where imperfect data is common.

## Limitations

While the project provides a complete and functional data pipeline, it has certain limitations by design. The scraper is tailored specifically to the current structure of the DA-IICT website, and significant changes to the website layout may require updates to the scraping logic.

The project uses SQLite, which is suitable for lightweight storage and academic use but may not scale efficiently for very large datasets or high-concurrency environments. Additionally, the API currently supports basic retrieval operations and does not include advanced filtering, pagination, or authentication mechanisms.

Semantic search and vector-based querying are not implemented in the current version; however, the data structure and `combined_text` field are intentionally designed to support these features in future extensions.


## Future Enhancements

This project is designed with extensibility in mind, and several improvements can be added in future iterations. A natural next step is to implement semantic search by generating vector embeddings from the `combined_text` field, allowing users to search faculty profiles using natural language queries. The API can be enhanced with filtering, pagination, and authentication to support more advanced use cases. For improved scalability and deployment, the pipeline and API can be containerized using Docker, and the SQLite database can be replaced with a production-grade relational database such as PostgreSQL. Additionally, automated scheduling and monitoring can be introduced to enable periodic data updates and long-term maintenance.
